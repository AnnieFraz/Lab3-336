                <p> A <strong>Turing Machine</strong> is an FSM(Finite State Machine) that controls one or more tapes, where at least one tape is of unbounded length (i.e. infinitely long).</p>
                <p>Alan Turing used his Turing machine to show that it is not possible to determine if any given problem has a solution, or not. This has serious implications in computing. It means that it may not always be possible to determine if a particular problem is unsolvable, or if it has just not been solved yet.</p>

                <p><span style=“color: red”> Turing Machines </span> consist of: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>An input alphabet</li>
                    <li>A tape that goes on infinitely in one direction</li>
                    <li>An output alphabet(characters that can be printed onto the tape)</li>
                    <li>A tape head that is used to read the contents of the tape one cell at a time</li>
                    <li>A finite set of states, including one initial state</li>
                    <li>A program (FSM set of instructions) that tells it which state to change to, which direction to move the tape head and which member of the output alphabet to place on the tape – based on the current state and the input received.</li>
                </ol>
